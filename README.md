</p>

A library for taking a human readable string, and converting to dates, seconds or whatever the implementor specifies for consumption.

The purpose is for usage in configuration files etc rather than using unreadable configurations, such as millisecond based definitions `70000`.

Based on (and dependent upon) [moment](https://momentjs.com).
